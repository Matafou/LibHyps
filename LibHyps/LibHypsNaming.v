(** ** The custom renaming tactic

  The tactic "rename_hyp" should be redefined along a coq development,
  it should return a fresh name build from a type th and a depth. It
  should fail if no name is found, so that the fallback scheme is
  called.

  Typical use, in increasing order of complexity, approximatively
  equivalent to the decreasing order of interest.

(** * Implementation principle:

   The name of the hypothesis will be a sequence of chunks. A chunk is
   a word generally starting with "_".

   Internally (not seen by the user) this sequence is represented by a
   list of small terms. One term of the form (∀ <chunk>:Prop, DUMMY
   <chunk>) per chunk. For instance the sequence "h_eq_foo" is
   represented by the following coq term:

   [(∀ h,DUMMY h) ; (∀ _eq,DUMMY _eq) ; (∀ _foo, DUMMY _foo)]

   where DUMMY is an opaque (identity) function but we don't care. *)

(* ********** CUSTOMIZATION ********** *)

(** If this is true, then all hyps names will have a trailing "_". In
    case of names ending with a digit (like in "le_1_2" or "le_x1_x2")
    this additional suffix avoids Coq's fresh name generation to
    *replace* the digit. Although this is esthetically bad, it makes
    things more predictable. You may set this to true for backward
    compatility. *)
